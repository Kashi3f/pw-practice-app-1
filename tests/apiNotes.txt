What is an API
Kind of black box testing
- Requesting different endpoints which returns an object
- GET
request specific data from API
- POST/PUT
Send data to a API to create/update a resource
- DELETE
Removes a specified resource

API URL - Https URL to API. Usually called API End-point
Headers - Usually it's Content-Type or Authorization token
METHODS - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Body - JSON object with requested data(for POST or PUT)

***HTTP ressponse satus codes***

Status code 2xx(201, 204, 205, ...) - Success
Status code 3xx(300, 301, 302, ...) -  Redirection
Status code 4xx(400, 401, 404, ...) - Client Error
400 - Request was not recognized
401 - Request was not authorized and you need to provide authorization token
404 - URL simply doesn't exist
Status code 5xx(500, 501, 502, ...) - Server Error

***UI Automation***
__Functional end-to-end testing__

Playwright --> Web-browser(clent) --> API(server)
           <--                    <--   

This is called a functional intergration test

Playwright --> Web-browser(clent) --> API(server)
           <--                    <--   
                       --> Playwright Mock
                       <-- 

This is called mocking of the API for validation, this approach allows you to mock the server failure and allows you to view the status code.

Playwright --> API server
           <-- 
Direct API calls from Playwright to the server. Very useful for a headless authorization when you don't need to use login and password screen everytime to login into application using the API call
You can directly call the API server, get API token, authorize your browser and then perform all the operations inside the browser.
