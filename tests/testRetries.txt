**Retry OFF**

Worker is initiated and palywright runs the test within this worker. Run tests in order by number if the selected test passes.
Worker is a new instance of a browser running in incognito mode. It's a new session that begins.

**PASS**            **FAIL**
Worker #1           Worker #1       
Test 1 - PASS       Test 1 - PASS
Test 2 - PASS       Test 2 - FAIL
Test 3 - PASS

If one test fails in Worker 1, playwright creates a new instance(Worker #2) and executes test 3 in a fresh browser but only if retry is off.

**Retry ON**

If Test 2 fails in the instance of worker 1, playwright creates a second worker and retries the execution of test 2 in the new instance.

Worker #1
Test 1 - PASS
Test 2 - FAIL

Worker #2
Test 2 - PASS
Test 3 - PASS

In the playwright.config.ts you can set the amount of retries on your local device on retries: proccess.env.CI ? 2 : 1, also, fullyParallel: false, tests will be executed 1 by 1 in only 1 worker.
In your test.describe you can set how many times the tests should be executed with this.
test.describe.configure({retries: 2})

If you want to run a precondition or clean the database before the second try, before each test runs you can use:

test('example test', async({page}, testInfo) => {
    if(testInfo.retry){ 
        //do something
    }
})

you can clean or clear the database and also set the run timenof each test.
